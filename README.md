# Vectorized_Backtest_With_Profit_Takes

   - V1: Comparing a vectorized vs looped back test of a simple moving average cross over strategy with profit taking thresholds


   - V2: Vectorsied backtest of a basic stat arb model
        - Long and Short spread trades
        - Only natural entry / exits (z-score +- 2 and ADF < 1%)
        - Need to implement stop loss
